This is the repository for the article on "A practical guide to the alignment of defocused spatial light modulators for fast diffractive neural networks" from IOPscience.

# Calibration Demonstration
The following gif is an example of the calibration procedure performed in this project.

On the left, the raw images acquired by the camera.

On the right, the post-processed images for an easier ellipse fitting.
